Overview

This project is a prototype for an improved automatic flagging system in the Touchstone Institute PRO Portal. It includes a backend API built with Node.js and TypeScript, and a frontend using AngularJS 1.x.

Prerequisites

You need Node.js (version 14 or higher recommended) and npm installed on your computer.

Backend Setup

Open a command prompt and go to the backend folder. Type npm install and press Enter to install dependencies. Start the backend server by typing npm run dev or npm start and press Enter. The backend will run at http://localhost:5000 by default.

Frontend Setup

Open a new command prompt and go to the frontend folder. Type npm install and press Enter to install dependencies. Start the frontend by typing npm start and press Enter. The frontend will run at http://localhost:4200 or another port if configured.

Usage

Make sure both the backend and frontend are running. Open your browser and go to the frontend address. Fill in candidate details and submit the form to see any generated flags.

If you have any issues or questions, make sure Node.js and npm are installed correctly and that you are using the right ports.
